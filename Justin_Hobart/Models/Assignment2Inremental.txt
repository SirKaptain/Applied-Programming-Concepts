Incremental Model:
Iteration 1:
	-The first iteration included the login system, as well as a barebones implementation of the user class and its three derived classes
	-A temporary built-in list of usernames and passwords was added for testing purposes
	-The class functions simply print an acknowledgement that they were called, but don't actually do anything, and cannot do anything until the databases are implemented.
Iteration 2:
	-The second iteration will include the user information database
	-The temporary testing usernames and passwords will be removed, and the login code will be altered slightly to utilize the new database
	-Some class functions will be available: ID's, names, and some other information will allow the various call object functions to be fleshed out
Iteration 3:
	-The third iteration will include the course information database
	-This will allow the remainder of the class functions to be fully fleshed out and utilized and the system as a whole will be just about complete
Iteration 4+:
	-All future iterations will involve more granular improvements and changes

Zoltan comments - This model is well-structured and adds a lot of good details. I would add a few more details such as the database must include
100 students etc. A few details about the concurrent activities like how validation would be done would also help.
