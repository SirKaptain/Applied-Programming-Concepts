Final Program Plan (Incremental):

Iteration 1:
    -Create the base user class:
        Attributes:
            First Name
            Last Name
            ID
        Methods: 
            Show Info
            Edit Info (all 3 attributes)
    -Create the three children classes:
        Student:
            Attribute:
                Schedule? (may make database)
            Methods:
                Search Course
                Add Course
                Drop Course
                Print Schedule
        Instructor:
            Attribute:
                Schedule? (may make database)
            Methods:
                Print Schedule
                Print Classlist
                Search Courses
        Admin:
            Methods:
                Add/Remove Courses
                Add/Remove Users
                Add/Remove Students from courses
                Search/Print Roster
                Search/Print Courses
        -Create all methods, however no need to implement function, only print acknologements that it works
        -Create a main test bench file for testing class method calls (this will be changed every iteration to incorperate additional features)

Iteration 2:
    Create functions for database handeling
        -Make general functions that work for ALL User methods
        -Will need to be tested before implementing into main program
        -incorperate functions into main program

Iteration 3:
    Create database(s)
        -Tables are as follows:
            STUDENT (ID, NAME, SURNAME, GRADYEAR, MAJOR, EMAIL)
            INSTRUCTOR (ID, NAME, SURNAME, TITLE, HIREYEAR, DEPT, EMAIL)
            ADMIN (ID, NAME, SURNAME, TITLE, OFFICE, EMAIL)
            COURSES (CRN, TITLE, DEPARTMENT, TIME, DAYS_OF_WEEK, SEMESTER, YEAR, CREDITS)
        -Must work for at least 100 Students, 10 Instructors, and 1 Admin
        -May need to make another table of students and currently enrolled classes along with instructors with enrolled students(so both admin and student/instructor can add/remove themselves from classes)

Iteration 4:
    Create login system for a user.
        - System should prompt user for login credentials
        - Once logged in, enter the main program
        -incorperate into main program

Iteration 5:
    Finalize the main program
        -Includes GUI and general "flow" of the program
    (added this at end because since all functionallity has been added before, developer knows exactly how everything fits together)
